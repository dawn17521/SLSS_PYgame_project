Flappy Bird - README
Welcome to Flappy Bird! This file will guide you through the steps to properly set up and run the game on your computer.

Getting Started
Step 1: Download and Unzip
Download the zip file containing the game.
Unzip the downloaded file. You will find the following contents:
A folder named Images containing the images required by the game.
Two files: main.py (the game script) and README.txt (this file).
Step 2: Running the Game
Ensure that the Images folder and the files (main.py and README.txt) are in the same directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you unzipped the files.
Run the game by executing the following command:


You:~$ python main.py


Troubleshooting
Error: "Images/background.png Missing"
If you encounter the error message "Images/background.png Missing" or "cannot find this file", follow these steps to resolve the issue:

Locate the parent directory of the SLSS_PYgame_project folder. For example, if the project folder is located at D:\flappy_bird\SLSS_PYgame_project, then D:\flappy_bird is the parent directory.
Move the Images folder to the parent directory. In this example, you should move the Images folder from D:\flappy_bird\SLSS_PYgame_project to D:\flappy_bird.
After moving the Images folder, the directory structure should look like this:



D:\flappy_bird
│
├── Images
│   ├── background.png
│   └── (other image files)
│
├── SLSS_PYgame_project
│   ├── main.py
│   └── README.txt
Now, try running the game again by executing python main.py.

Enjoy the Game!
