reference: flappy bird
Hello Everyone, this is the readme file of the game flappy bird
to properly run this game on your computer, the first thing you need to do is to download the zip file in to your computer, and then unzip the file, there will be two files and one folder, the folder contains the images that game needs to run. The files are python scripts and text file which introduce the game(which is this file, the readme file). After unzip the file, you can run the main.py file to run the game, sometimes there will be "Images/background.png"Missing or cannot find this file error pop out, don't worry, i will help you fix this issue.

Solve for "Images/background.png"Missing

the solution for this error is to move the image folder to the parent directory of this folder.

 "'Images/background.png' is MISSING from directory 'D:\flappy_bird\SLSS_PYgame_project'"

 this is the error message.

 the parent directory is the directory where it contains SLSS_PYgame_project and other stuff, in this example here the parent directory of the SLSS_PYgame_project folder is 'D:\flappy_bird'

 after you find the directory, all you need to do is to copy the images folder from 'D:\flappy_bird\SLSS_PYgame_project' to 'D:\flappy_bird', and it will run the program properly

 thank you for playing !!!
